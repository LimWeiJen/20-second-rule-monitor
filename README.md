# 20 Second Rule Monitor

### About
---
A chrome extension that prevents procrastination using the 20 second rule. Built using typescript.

### What is the 20 second rule?
---
The 20 second rule is clearly explained in this [video](https://youtu.be/lj5SzG4XHJo). In short, the 20 second rule states that If we need to spend more than 20 seconds to 
prepare for a certain task, it's very likely that we will not do the task. 
<br><br>
We tend to procrastinate because it is very easy for us to prepare for it; 
we just have to go to our preferred social media website, and we can start procrastinating. 
<br><br>
To prevent procrastination, we just have to make it 
20 seconds harder for us to procrastinate. This chrome extension does exactly that.

### Features
---
Every time we go to our social media website, this chrome extension is going to prevent us from interacting with the website for 20 seconds. We can use this time to reconsider
our decision for procrastinating ^_^
<br><br>
We can tap on the icon of this chrome extension to configure the targetted websites.
